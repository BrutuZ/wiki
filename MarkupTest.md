# Markup test

The div style alerts were from the old wiki. The wiki.js format is the blockquote style.

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
  
  <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-info-sign"></span>
  &nbsp;
  This was old style with glyphs.
  New wiki.js style always has glyphs, don't think there is a way to remove.
</div>

<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">foobar</div>
<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">asdf</div>
<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">foobar</div>
<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">asdf</div>

> foobar
{.is-success}

> asdf
{.is-info}

> foobar
{.is-warning}

> foobar
{.is-danger}

[](/Includes/EnvDiv){.include}
