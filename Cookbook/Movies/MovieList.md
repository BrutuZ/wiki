# Fill movie_list from 3rd party input
This task will add movies from [trakt.tv](http://trakt.tv) watchlist to your [movie_list](/Plugins/List/movie_list). This is not intended to download anything, just fill the FlexGet movie list from there. You will have to have another task to do the actual downloading with the [list_match](/Plugins/List/list_match) to accept entries. You can remove [trakt_list](/Plugins/List/trakt_list) plugin from this recipe if you do not want to use that particular site and use another eg. [imdb_list](/Plugins/List/imdb_list), [couchpotato_list](/Plugins/List/couchpotato_list).

```
tasks:
  watchlist:
    priority: 1
    trakt_list:
      account: my_acc_name
      list: watchlist
      type: movies
    accept_all: yes
    seen: local  # We don't want accepted movies on this feed to affect actual download feed
    list_add:
      - movie_list: watchlist  # you can call this whatever you want
```

**NOTE:** Make sure you don't have download/deluge/transmission plugin in this task, (or in a global template,) you aren't actually downloading anything here.
