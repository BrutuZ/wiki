# Downloading Apple Trailers

### Quick Start

 [Apple Trailers Plugin](/Plugins/apple_trailers)

### Downloading Trailers By Genre

This method involves looking up movie titles through the [imdb_lookup plugin](/Plugins/imdb_lookup) or the [thetvdb_lookup plugin](/Plugins/thetvdb_lookup). It is then followed up with an [if filter](/Plugins/if) to sort out the genres you don't want included. In the example below, the genres of Documentary, Foreign, Comedy, Fantasy, or Musical were rejected.

```
AppleTrailers:
  rss: http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/home/rss/newtrailers.rss
  imdb_lookup: yes
  if:
    - "any(genre in ['documentary', 'foreign', 'comedy', 'fantasy', 'musical'] for genre in imdb_genres)": reject
  set:
    filename: '{{title}} - Trailer - 720p.mov'
```
