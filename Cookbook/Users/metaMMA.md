# Configuration for downloading MMA events

### Below is a sample config.yml file which does the following:

 - downloads MMA events from Demonoid RSS feed.
   - Bellator MMA
   - Glory (kickboxing)
   - Invicta FC
   - LFA (Legacy Fighting Alliance)
   - One Championship
   - Titan FC
   - UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship)
   - WSOF (World Series of Fighting)
   - UFC Now (tv show)
 - keeps track of downloads to prevent duplicates.
 - uses deluge as the client to download torrents.
 - only downloads files in 720p resolution.


### The following changes can be made:
 - replace everything below beginning with `QQQ` with your relevant information.
 - if using a different download client, replace all lines indented under `deluge` with corresponding lines for a different [supported download client](https://flexget.com/Plugins#output).
 - Note: `movedone` can only be used with deluge plugin.
 - The quality can be changed from 720p. [See here](https://flexget.com/Plugins/quality)
 - The `user-agent` must be changed. [This site](www.whoishostingthis.com/tools/user-agent/) displays your user-agent.
 - Save the [correct cookies](https://github.com/metaMMA/metaMMA/wiki/Using-FlexGet-to-automate-downloads#4-optional-if-using-a-vpn-cookies-may-need-to-be-stored)
