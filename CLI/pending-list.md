#### Return all pending lists names
```bash
$ flexget pending-list all
```

#### List all entries from an pending list
```bash
$ flexget pending-list list <list_name>
```

#### Show details about a specific entry
```bash
$ flexget pending-list show <list_name> <entry>
```

#### Add or update an entry on an pending list and mark it as approved.
Using a title and original URL is require. You can also add additional identifiers in the following format:

```bash
$ flexget pending-list add <list_name> <entry_title> <original_url> --attributes imdb_id=tt1234556 tmdb_id=1234 --approved
```

If the given entry list does not exist it will be created.

If the entry with the title exists on that list, its *entire* list of attributes will be replaced by the given list of attributes (or removed altogether if such a list was not given). 

#### Removing an entry from an pending list
```bash
$ flexget pending-list del <list_name> <entry>
```

#### Clearing an entire pending list
```bash
$ flexget pending-list purge <list_name>
```

### Approving an entry on a pending list
```bash
$ flexget pending-list approve <list_name> <entry TITLE or ID>
```

### Rejecting an entry from a pending list

$ felxget pending-list reject <list_name> <entry TITLE or ID>
