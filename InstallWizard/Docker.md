# [Install Wizard](/InstallWizard) > Docker

## Install Docker

Follow the instructions for your operating system [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

## Running a Docker FlexGet image

You have 2 options:
 - Use a premade image from Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry, etc.
 - Build your own Docker image
 
 Here are some public images from Docker Hub or GitHub:
  - [wiserain/flexget](https://hub.docker.com/r/wiserain/flexget)
  - [cpoppema/docker-flexget](https://hub.docker.com/r/cpoppema/docker-flexget)
  - [cptactionhank/flexget](https://hub.docker.com/r/cptactionhank/flexget)
  - [ksurl/flexget](https://hub.docker.com/r/ksurl/flexget) or [ghcr.io/ksurl/flexget](https://github.com/ksurl/docker-flexget/pkgs/container/flexget) 

If you want to build your own, the Synology installation has a docker option with [instructions](/InstallWizard/SynologyNAS/Docker) (adjust to your OS as needed since some instructions are Synology specific such as the volume paths).
