## Resources
 * [Good overview of SQLAlchemy concepts](http://techspot.zzzeek.org/2012/02/07/patterns-implemented-by-sqlalchemy/)

## Contributing
Making custom plugins should be easy for anyone with some python experience.

If you're working on good re-usable plugin we're be more than happy to include it in official distribution. See [Contribute](/Contribute) for more information.

## Unit testing
FlexGet has over 1200 unit tests so changes are that if your modifications pass the tests nothing major has been broken.

## Enhancement proposals
 * [Drafts](/_index/Drafts/)
 * [Roadmap](/Roadmap)

## Running IPython inside FlexGet
First install IPython

```bash
bin/pip install ipython
```

And then place this where you wish to hack:

```
import IPython; IPython.embed()
```
