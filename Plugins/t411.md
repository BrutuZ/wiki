# T411
This plugin can be used as a search or an input plugin for getting results from [Torrent411](https://www.t411.ai/).

## Configuration
### Setting your account
The plugin needs your credentials for working. Use the CLI for setting these:
```
flexget t411 add-auth <username> <password>
```
The [CLI t411 wiki entry](/CLI/t411) also has more information.

### Schema
You must specify at least a category and use optionnals `terms` and/or `max_results`.
```yml
t411:
  category: <category name>
  terms:
    - <begin of term name>
  max_results: 100 (default)
```

You can list all available categories or sub-categories of one with the [CLI](/CLI/t411):
```
flexget t411 list-cats
flexget t411 list-cats eBook
```

You can list all available terms, available terms of a category or terms of a (implemented soon) type of terms:
```
flexget t411 list-terms
flexget t411 list-terms --category Livres
flexget t411 list-terms --type Langue
```

Notice your configuration file does not have to include the full name of an end but only the beginning. Thus, `HDrip 1080 [Rip HD depuis Bluray]` may have written `HDrip 1080`.

## Additional information
The plugin can use the details of a torrent to complete or overwrite the video quality that Flexget determined from the title.
To use this feature, add `t411_lookup: <fill | override>` to your configuration file
To illustrate, an entry titled `My.Favourite.Serie.S01E01.1080p.dd5.1` with the video quality term `TVripHD 720p` will produce :
* `1080p hdtv dd5.1` with `fill` option
* `720p hdtv dd5.1` with `override` option

## Examples
### Search new serie releases
This exemple show the usage of the search plugin and the lookup plugin :
```yml
discover:
  what:
    - emit_series: yes
  from:
    - t411:
        category: Série TV
        terms:

          - Web-DL 720

t411_lookup: fill
```
