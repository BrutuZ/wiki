  &nbsp; This is part of [managed list](/Plugins/List) plugin system.

Creates an [Entry](/Entry) for each movie in your [couchpotato](https://couchpota.to/) wanted list. This plugin can be used with the [movie_list ](/Plugins/List/movie_list) plugin to add those movies to the list.

## Plugin Settings
Currently the following settings are required:


|  Option  |  Description  |
| --- | --- |
| **base_url** | This is the URL of your couchpotato installation (usually http://localhost). If not specified otherwise, assumes the port is 80 by default.  |
| **api_key** | This is API key of your couchpotato installation (can be found under settings->general->advanced)   |
| **include_data** | Flag that enables whether to send Couchpotato's quality profile to FlexGet. Default is False   |

The following setting are optional:


|  Option  |  Description  |
| --- | --- |
| **port** | This is the port used by your couchpotato installation (usually 5050). Use this if your CP installation is at a different port than 80 (which it probably is).  |
