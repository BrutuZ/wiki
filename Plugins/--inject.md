# Inject
Allows injecting imaginary entry for FlexGet to process. You can also use [the inject cli command](/CLI/inject) for a slightly easier format.

**Syntax:**

```text
--inject <TITLE> [URL] [ACCEPT] [FORCE]
```
        
Without URL a random url will be generated. All other inputs are disabled.

**Example use:**
        
```bash
flexget execute --inject "Some.Series.S02E12.Imaginary" --tasks my-series --learn
```
        
This would inject imaginary series into a single task and learn it as a downloaded,
assuming task accepts the injected entry.

**Example use 2:**
        
```bash
flexget execute --tasks some.task --inject "Some.Title" "Some.direct.url" accept force
```
        
This would inject imaginary title with direct link to file into a single task, accept it and force it trough even if some filter tries to reject it.

### Setting Entry Fields
You can also set arbitrary [entry fields](/Entry) when injecting. This is done in entryfield=value format. These can be listed at any point after the url.

**Example:**

```bash
flexget execute --tasks some.task --inject "Some Title" "Some.direct.url" imdb_id=tt33333
```
