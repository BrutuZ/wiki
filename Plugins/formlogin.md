# Form Login
Log in to a site using a webform

This plugin requires the mechanicalsoup library. To install it, run:

```cmd
$ pip install mechanicalsoup
```

### Example
```yaml
form:
  url: http://example.com/login.php
  username: <username>
  password: <password>
```

### Example 2
The login module just performs the login, you need to use other plugins to process content from the site:

```yaml
form:
  url: http://example.com/login.php
  username: <username>
  password: <password>
html:
  url: http://example.com/browse.php?cat=1
regexp:
  accept:
    - Paddy.Obrien
```
