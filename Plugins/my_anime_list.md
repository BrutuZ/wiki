# MyAnimeList

This plugin produces an [entry](/Entry) for each item on [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net) list. It can be used as a source for the [configure_series](/Plugins/configure_series) plugin.

**Notes:** 

 * Like with other APIs used by FlexGet the MyAnimeList is cached for 2 hours to avoid hammering.
