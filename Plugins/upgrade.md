### Example for movies
In this example the first task will download movies based on imdb ratings. The second task will upgrade the movies already downloaded for 7 days.

```
tasks:
  high_rated_movies:
    upgrade:
      # We must add this so the upgrade plugin can track the downloaded qualities
      tracking: yes
    imdb_high_rated:
      imdb:
      min_score: 8.5
      min_votes: 5000

  upgrade_movies:
    upgrade:
      target: 1080p
      propers: yes
```

### Example for series

Series currently has the concept of upgrade. In the future series will be migrated to leverage this upgrade plugin.

In this example the first task will download epsiodes for existing series on the filesystem. The second task will upgrade any downloaded series.

```
tasks:
  existing_tv_shows:
    upgrade:
      # We must add this so the upgrade plugin can track the downloaded qualities
      tracking: yes
    configure_series:
      from:
        filesystem:
          - /media/series/

  upgrade_tv:
    upgrade:
      target: 1080p
      propers: yes
```

### Example with [timeframe](https://flexget.com/Plugins/timeframe)

In this example the first task will download epsiodes for existing series on the filesystem. It will wait for 720p for 6 hours if not accept what ever quality is available.

The second task will upgrade any downloaded series.

```
tasks:
  existing_tv_shows:
    upgrade:
      # We must add this so the upgrade plugin can track the downloaded qualities
      tracking: yes
    timeframe:
      wait: 6 hours
      target: 720p+
    configure_series:
      from:
        filesystem:
          - /media/series/
