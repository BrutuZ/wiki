# Notify Entries
[Includes/PluginReplacedArchived](/Includes/PluginReplacedArchived){.include}

Use this plugin to send notification to one or more [notifer](/Plugins/Notifiers) plugins about the task entries.
This plugin runs on task exit and can be configured extensively

> This plugin will send a single notification per accepted entry by default, and get send one per rejected, failed undecided or all of them combined </a>
{.is-info}

### Config:

| Options |Type|  Description | Default |
| --- | ---| --- |---|
|**to**|list|List of at least one notifer plugin; the same plugin can be used more than once. **Required**
|what|text| One or more of `entries`, `accepted`, `rejected`, `failed` or `undecided`. The data type to get notified on. |`accepted`

You can also set any other attribute in the config, which will be passed to all configured notifiers. A default `title`, `message` and `url` are set depending on the selected scope.

The schema can also take any other property which will be passed to the configured notifier plugins.
<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
  <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-info-sign"></span>
  &nbsp;
  All passed attributes support
  <a href="/Jinja/" class="alert-link">Jinja2</a>
</div>

### Basic usage:
Looking at the schema, we can see that by default, using the minimal `notify_entries` setting, a notifier will be defined as such:
```yaml
tasks:
  download_task:
    rss: http://stuff.com
    accept_all: yes
    download: /downloads/
    notify_entries:
      to:
        - pushover:
            user_key: user_key
```
This will send a notification for each `accepted` entry. It is functionally similar to direcly calling the notifier plugin in the task as such:
```yaml
tasks:
  download_task:
    rss: http://stuff.com
    accept_all: yes
    download: /downloads/
    pushover:
      user_key: user_key
```
#### Advanced usage 1:
```yaml
tasks:
  download_task:
    rss: http://stuff.com
    regexp:
      accept_excluding:
        - bla
    download: /downloads/
    notify_entries:
      to:
        - pushover:
            user_key: user_key
        - email:
           to: address@someone.com
      what: rejected
      title: "Rejected entries in task {{ task_name }}"
      message: "Entry {{ title }} was rejected due to {{ reason }}"
```
This will trigger a notification for both `pushover` and `email` for each rejected entry.
#### Advanced usage 2:
```yaml
tasks:
  download_task:
    rss: http://stuff.com
    regexp:
      accept_excluding:
        - bla
    download: /downloads/
    notify_entries:
      to:
        - pushover:
            user_key: user_key
            message: "Task {{ task_name }} is done!"
        - email:
           to: address@someone.com
      title: "Accepted {{ title }}"
```
In this example we use the global `title` to be passed to both `pushover` and `email`. The global `message` attribute is passed to `email` but `pushover` configured its `message internally, overriding the global value. 

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
  <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-info-sign"></span>
  &nbsp;
  Internal plugin attributes overide global ones
</div>

### Jinja2 usage
As can be viewed in the example, all attributes support Jinja2 usage. So you can render messages like this:
```yaml
tasks:
  download_stuff:
    rss: http://stuff.com
    accept_all: yes
    imdb_lookup: yes
    tmdb_lookup: yes
    tvmaze_lookup: yes
    notify_entries:
      to:
      - telegram:
          bot_token: '{{secrets.credentials.telegram.bot_token}}'
          parse_mode: markdown
          recipients:
            - username: '{{secrets.credentials.telegram.username}}'
          message: |+
            {%if task in ["retreive_from_couchpotato","dynamic_imdb_actors"]%}*New movie added to list*
            {%else%}*Download Started from task:
            *{{task|replace("_", "-")}}
            {%endif%}
            {% if series_name is defined -%}
            *{{series_name}}* - {{series_id}} - {{quality|d('')}}
            *{{tvmaze_episode_name|d(tvdb_ep_name)|d('')}}*
            [Image]({{tvmaze_series_original_image|replace("_", "%5F")}})
            [Show page]({{tvmaze_series_url|replace("_", "%5F")}})
            {% elif imdb_name is defined -%}
            *{{imdb_name}}* - ({{imdb_year}})
            {{quality|d('')}}
            {{imdb_score}}/10 - {{imdb_votes}} votes
            {{imdb_genres|join(', ')|title}} 
            *Plot:* {{imdb_plot_outline}}
            [Image]({{tmdb_posters[0]|replace("_", "%5F")}})
            [Movie Page]({{imdb_url|d('')}})
            {% else -%}
            {{title}}
            {%- endif -%}
```

While these advanced templates can be very useful, they can appear bery bulky in the config. Instead you could use the `file_template` attribute:
```yaml
tasks:
  download_task:
    rss: http://stuff.com
    regexp:
      accept_excluding:
        - bla
    download: /downloads/
    notify_entries:
      to:
        - pushover:
            user_key: user_key
      scope: task
      file_template: default
```
When using `file_template` it will render it and pass it as the `message` attribute.  
Some default file templates are supplied with flexget and are found under `/templates` dir in Flexget's run path. To use custom templates, simply create a `filename.template` file with the relevant data, and place it under `/templates` dir of the config path.  
As with all other attributes, `file_template` can be used globally or within a specfic notifer config.  
To view all available file templates use the [templates](/CLI/templates) command:  
```bash
flexget templates
```
### Using the same notifier more than once
There is no limitation to the number of times the same notifer can be used within a `notify_entries` config:
```yaml
tasks:
  download_task:
    rss: http://stuff.com
    regexp:
      accept_excluding:
        - bla
    download: /downloads/
    notify_entries:
      to:
        - pushover:
            user_key: user_key1
        - pushover:
            user_key: user_key2
```
