# AwesomeHD
This search plugin will get tv seasons (they do not allow single episodes) and movie results from AwesomeHD. While their API provides a `type` parameter in the response, it seems to always be `Movie`, even for tv shows.

**NOTE: Their API only supports searching with IMDb id, so make sure you have `imdb_lookup: yes` in your config.**

## Configuration
Only required parameter is `passkey`, which can be found on your AHD profile. This key is unique to your account so guard it well!

```
awesomehd:
  passkey: <passkey>
  only_internal: true|false (default false)
```
Alternative config (`only_internal` still defaults to `False`):
```
awesomehd: <passkey>
```
