# Third-Party Plugin Template and Instructions

This page provides and explains the template for a third-party plugin wiki page. A complete template with no explanation text is available [here](/_edit/Site/ThirdPartyPluginTemplateFull). (Copy and paste the Markdown source from that page into your plugin's wiki page. **Do not** save changes directly at that link.)

## Plugin Info
At the top, enter the link to your plugin, the plugin name (which should match the wiki page URL), and a link to where users can submit issues.

If your plugin is installed as a Python package, change the text `Includes/ThirdPartyPluginInstallDotFlexget` to `Includes/ThirdPartyPluginInstallPackage` in both places where it appears in the final template. The plugin link in that case must be the URL of the location where your plugin's package can be found and installed with `pip`. For an example of such a URL, see the [GitHub page](https://github.com/Flexget/extras#install) for the extras package.

Do not otherwise modify the imports.

```yaml
---
plugin_link: "[GitHub](https://github.com/example/example-repo/blob/master/example-plugin.py)"
plugin_name: app_deluge_find
plugin_issues: "[GitHub](https://github.com/example/example-repo/issues)"
import:
- Includes/ThirdPartyPluginWarning
- Includes/ThirdPartyPluginInstallDotFlexget
- Includes/ThirdPartyPluginIssues
---
```

## Title and Description
The `Plugin Title` should generally be the same as the name, with underscores removed and words capitalized. Enter a general description of the plugin. Do not modify the line below the plugin title.

```markdown
# Plugin Title
[Includes/ThirdPartyPluginWarning](/Includes/ThirdPartyPluginWarning){.include}


This is where your plugin description goes.
```


## Installation
Install instructions are provided in an imported bit of text. If your plugin is installed as a Python package, change the text `Includes/ThirdPartyPluginInstallDotFlexget` to `Includes/ThirdPartyPluginInstallPackage` in both places where it appears in the final template. Do not otherwise modify this line.
```yaml
[Includes/ThirdPartyPluginInstallDotFlexget](/Includes/ThirdPartyPluginInstallDotFlexget){.include}
```

## Usage
Describe the plugin's usage scenarios. Include example configurations.

If your plugin takes options, include a table that describes them. Required options should be in **bold**.

For formatting reasons, an extra `\` (backslash) is inserted before the three backticks on two lines in the example below. Remove this backslash on your actual plugin page.

```markdown
## Usage
Usage description text.

| **Option** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **required_option** | This option makes the plugin do XYZ. |
| optional_option | If present, this option will cause ABC to happen. |

Example config:
```yaml
my_plugin:
  required_option: blue
\```

Example with optional features:
```yaml
my_plugin:
  required_option: blue
  optional_option: green
\```
```

## Issues
The issues link is provided in an imported bit of text. The link to your issues page is designated in the first section. Do not modify this section.

```
[Includes/ThirdPartyPluginIssues](/Includes/ThirdPartyPluginIssues){.include}
```
